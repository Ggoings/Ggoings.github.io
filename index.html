                Hello, Welcome to my portfolio. I'm 24 years old and born and raised in Kansas. Im attending Kansas University Coding Bootcamp Program to increase my knowledge in programming and turning this into a future career.

            <p>
                My past employment was working as a Assembler for BG Products Inc. after around a year in this field I knew that this career was not for me and wanted to do better. I picked web development because the day and age we are in is all based off computers which I want to learn how to create the software.
